# MakiScreen
> ðŸ“º Streaming OBS video into maps on item frames at a high frame rate

[![](youtube-embed.png)](https://youtu.be/IvEZr8z5eu4)

## How does it work

- Load jar plugin onto 1.17.1 Paper server
- It will start a thread to listen for UDP packets on port 1337
- Use ffmpeg to send [OBS Virtual Camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfrknjDzukI) as JPG frames to the UDP socket
- Renders the latest available frame in Minecraft! 

## Get started (It's not easy, and it's experimental)

**Beware that map ID 0 to 32 will probably be overwritten**

- Download [MakiScreen](https://github.com/makitsune/MakiScreen/releases/tag/1.0) jar and place in Spigot 1.13+ server plugins
- Download [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and make sure it's in your path
- Download [OBS](https://obsproject.com)
- Run **Paper** server and make sure port **1337 UDP** is available, and then turn it off after the server has finished starting up
- Change the ***size*** setting in config.yml to match your output resolution
- Run **OBS** and make sure the output resolution is according to the config option and the base resolution is set to same as the config or any resolution with 2:1 aspect ratio, and set the frame rate to **20**
- Turn on your ***OBS Virtual Camera***
- Open terminal shell and enter `ffmpeg -y -f dshow -thread_queue_size 4096 -hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda -i video="OBS Virtual Camera" -i "Map_colors_paletteuse.png" -lavfi "paletteuse" -f rawvideo -c:v mjpeg -qscale:v 3 -r 20 udp://127.0.0.1:1337`
  - you can remove `-hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda` if you're not using nvidia GPU
  - remove this `-i "Map_colors_paletteuse.png" -lavfi "paletteuse"` dither filter if you had a problem with performance
  - set `-qscale:v 3` from 1 to 31 to lower your bitrate
- Run **Paper** server and Type `/maki` in Minecraft to get the maps
